This repository contains a Python example demonstrating how to handle less common exceptions such as KeyError, TypeError, and ZeroDivisionError that can easily slip into your code if not properly addressed.  The `bug.py` file shows the problem and the `bugSolution.py` file shows how to handle these errors gracefully. The solution handles these exceptions by implementing a try-except block that provides informative error messages to the user instead of letting the program crash unexpectedly.  This prevents unexpected program termination and enhances code robustness.
